# Disclaimer
* This project was focused on collective development and git management rather than clean code (althoug we tried)/scalable architecture/the resulting game itself (althoug we tried)
* At that time none of us had any skills in game dev or any expirience with Unity
* This repo is actually a mirror of https://gitlab.com/volkfm98/mkr

# MKR project
In short this is our study project for Methods of Colletive Developmnt ("Методы Коллктивной Разработки" -> MKR).
This is a little puzzle game made on Unity engine.
